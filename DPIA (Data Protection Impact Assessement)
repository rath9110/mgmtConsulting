Article 6: The 6 Lawful Bases for Processing
You cannot touch customer data unless you can point to one of these six "buckets." As a consultant, your job is to tell a business which bucket they belong in to avoid "Consent Fatigue."

1. Consent - The user said "Yes" clearly and affirmatively. (Use for: Newsletters, high-level tracking).

2. Contract - You need the data to deliver what they bought. (Use for: Shipping addresses, payment info).

3. Legal Obligation - The law says you have to. (Use for: Tax records, employment data).

4. Vital Interests - Someone’s life is at risk. (Use for: Emergency medical data).

5. Public Task - You are a government or public body.

6. Legitimate Interests - The most flexible bucket. The business has a good reason that doesn't override the user's rights. (Use for: Fraud prevention, basic website analytics).

**Article 35: Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

A DPIA is a document that asks: 
1. What are we doing? 
2. Is it necessary? 
3. What could go wrong? 
4. How do we stop it?

***When a DPIA is necessary
A DPIA is required whenever processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. A DPIA is required at least in the following  cases:

- A systematic and extensive evaluation of the personal aspects of an individual, including profiling;
- Processing of sensitive data on a large scale;
- Systematic monitoring of public areas on a large scale.

Example of when a DPIA is required
- A bank screening its customers against a credit reference database
- A hospital about to implement a new health information database with patients’ health data
- A bus operator about to implement on-board cameras to monitor drivers’ and passengers’ behaviour.

example of when a DPIA is not required
- A community doctor processing personal data of his patients. In that case, there is no need for a DPIA since the processing by the community doctors isn’t done on a large scale in cases where the number of patients is limited.

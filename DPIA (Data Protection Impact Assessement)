**Article 35: Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

A DPIA is a document that outlines, according to paragraph 7: 
(a) Systematic Description & Purpose
 You must provide a comprehensive map of how the data flows and why. This includes the nature, scope, and context of the processing.

(b) Necessity & Proportionality Assessment
You must prove that the data you are collecting is actually needed to achieve your goal and that you aren't over-collecting.

(c) Risk Assessment (Rights & Freedoms)
You must identify the specific risks to individuals. This isn't just about data breaches, but also risks like "function creep," discrimination via algorithms, or lack of transparency.

(d) Mitigation Measures & Safeguards
You must list the specific technical and organizational security measures you are putting in place to neutralize the risks identified in point (c).

***When a DPIA is necessary
A DPIA is required whenever processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. A DPIA is required at least in the following  cases:

- A systematic and extensive evaluation of the personal aspects of an individual, including profiling;
- Processing of sensitive data on a large scale;
- Systematic monitoring of public areas on a large scale.

Example of when a DPIA is required
- A bank screening its customers against a credit reference database
- A hospital about to implement a new health information database with patients’ health data
- A bus operator about to implement on-board cameras to monitor drivers’ and passengers’ behaviour.

example of when a DPIA is not required
- A community doctor processing personal data of his patients. In that case, there is no need for a DPIA since the processing by the community doctors isn’t done on a large scale in cases where the number of patients is limited.

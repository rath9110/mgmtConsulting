**The 7 Core Principles: Article 5 of GDPR
The core principles are explicitly outlined in Article 5(1) of the GDPR. These are the "rules of the road" for any data controller.

Article 5(1)(a): Personal data shall be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency). -> You must identify a specific "legal basis" for processing data (such as user consent or a contract) and be open and honest with the data subject about your intentions.

Article 5(1)(b): Personal data shall be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes (Purpose Limitation). -> You must clearly state why you are collecting data and only use it for those specific purposes. You cannot repurpose data for a new, incompatible goal without a new legal basis.

Article 5(1)(c): Personal data shall be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (Data Minimization). -> You should only collect the absolute minimum amount of data necessary to achieve your stated purpose. If a data point isn't required for the transaction, it should not be collected.

Article 5(1)(d): Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date (Accuracy). -> All reasonable steps must be taken to ensure personal data is not misleading and is kept up to date. Records that are incorrect must be erased or rectified without delay.

Article 5(1)(e): Personal data shall be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed (Storage Limitation). -> You must not keep personal data for longer than you need it. Every organization should have a clear retention policy that defines when data is automatically deleted or anonymized.

Article 5(1)(f): Personal data shall be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage (Integrity and Confidentiality). -> You must ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect data against unauthorized processing, accidental loss, or destruction. This includes encryption, access controls, and cybersecurity protocols.

Article 5(2): The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (Accountability). -> The most critical principle for management - you are responsible for complying with the other six principles and must be able to demonstrate that compliance through documentation, audits, and logs.

**The 8 Rights of the Data Subject: Articles 12–22 of GDPR
Unlike the principles, the rights are spread across Chapter III (Articles 12 to 22). Here is where they are specifically defined:

Articles 13 & 14: The Right to be Informed. These articles detail the information that must be provided to the user when data is collected, whether directly or from a third party. -> Organizations must be completely transparent about how they collect and use data. This is typically satisfied through clear, accessible privacy notices provided at the moment of data collection.

Article 15: The Right of Access. This gives the data subject the right to obtain confirmation from the controller as to whether or not personal data concerning them are being processed, and access to that data. -> Individuals have the right to request a copy of their personal data and understand how it is being processed. You must be able to provide this data in a concise and transparent manner.

Article 16: The Right to Rectification. This mandates that the data subject has the right to obtain the rectification of inaccurate personal data without undue delay. -> If a customer’s data is inaccurate or incomplete, they have the right to have it corrected. In a retail environment, this often involves syncing updates across CRM, ERP, and marketing platforms.

Article 17: The Right to Erasure ('Right to be Forgotten'). This allows the data subject to request the deletion of their data under specific conditions (e.g., data is no longer necessary or consent is withdrawn). -> Individuals can request the deletion of their data when there is no compelling legal or business reason for its continued processing (e.g., after a contract ends or consent is withdrawn).

Article 18: The Right to Restriction of Processing. This gives the user the right to "freeze" processing in specific cases, such as when the accuracy of the data is contested. -> Instead of full deletion, a user can request that their data be "frozen." You keep the data on file (for legal or tax reasons) but must ensure it is not used for active processing like marketing or analytics.

Article 20: The Right to Data Portability. This gives the data subject the right to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and transmit it to another controller. -> This allows individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different services. You must provide the data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format (like JSON or CSV).

Article 21: The Right to Object. This gives the user the right to object to processing based on "legitimate interests" or "public interest," and an absolute right to object to direct marketing. -> Individuals can object to the processing of their data for specific purposes, such as direct marketing, scientific research, or tasks carried out in the public interest.

Article 22: Rights related to Automated Decision-Making, including Profiling. This states that a data subject has the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing which produces legal or similarly significant effects. -> This protects individuals against high-risk decisions made solely by automated systems (AI) without human intervention. You must provide a way for customers to request a manual human review of an automated decision.

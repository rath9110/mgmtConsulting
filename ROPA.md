**ROPA:
Controllers and processors of data needs to maintain records of processing activities (often abbreviated as RoPA) - It's an obligation to document personal data processing activities. It requires organizations to create and maintain a structured internal record describing how and why personal data is processed. These records are not meant to be published or shared with the public. Instead, they must be made available to supervisory authorities upon request.

Article 30 answers the following questions:
- What personal data do we process?
- Why do we process it?
- Whose data is it?
- Where does it go?
- How long do we keep it?
- How do we protect it?

***Article 30 includes an exemption for organizations with fewer than 250 employees, but this exemption is often misinterpreted.
The exemption does not apply if:
- The processing is not occasional
- The processing includes special categories of data
- The processing is likely to result in a risk to data subjects’ rights and freedoms

***In reality, most modern businesses process personal data regularly and systematically, meaning the exemption rarely applies. Some examples of non-occasional processing includes:
- Customer account management
- Email marketing
- Website analytics
- User authentication


**Required Information for Controllers
Controllers must document the following elements for each processing activity:

- Name and contact details of the controller
- Purposes of the processing
- Categories of data subjects
- Categories of personal data
- Categories of recipients
- International data transfers and safeguards
-Retention periods
- Technical and organizational security measures
- Each processing activity should be described clearly and consistently.

**Required Information for Processors
Processors must document:

- Name and contact details of the processor and controllers
- Categories of processing carried out on behalf of controllers
- International data transfers and safeguards
- Technical and organizational security measures
- Processors are not required to document purposes, since these are determined by the controller.

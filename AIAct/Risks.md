**EU AI Act 
The Pyramid of Risk: The Act categorizes AI into four levels.

1. Unacceptable Risk: (Banned since Feb 2025). All AI systems considered a clear threat to the safety, livelihoods and rights of people are banned. The AI Act prohibits eight practices, namely:
- Harmful AI-based manipulation and deception
- Harmful AI-based exploitation of vulnerabilities
- Social scoring
- Individual criminal offence risk assessment or prediction
- Untargeted scraping of the internet or CCTV material to create or expand facial recognition databases
- Emotion recognition in workplaces and education institutions
- Biometric categorisation to deduce certain protected characteristics
- Real-time remote biometric identification for law enforcement purposes in publicly accessible spaces

2. High-Risk: Heavily regulated (coming online Aug 2026). This covers "critical" areas like infrastructure, education, and law enforcement.
3. Limited Risk: Mostly transparency obligations (e.g., you must know you're talking to a bot).
4. Minimal Risk: No obligations (e.g., spam filters, video games).

Deployer: Someone professionally using an AI system

Provider: Someone that develops an AI system or general-purpose AI model, or has such a system developed and places it on the market or puts it into service under their own name or trademark. A deployer can become a provider if Nn existing high-risk AI system is;

- marketed under a new name or brand (Art. 25 para. 1 lit. a);
- undergoes substantial modifications to its functionality or safety (Art. 25 para. 1 lit. b); or
- The intended purpose of the system is modified, so that an AI system originally not classified as high-risk is now considered a high-risk AI system (Art. 25 para. 1 lit. c).

***Responsibilities or authorities, providers and deployers:
Once an AI system is on the market, authorities are in charge of market surveillance, deployers ensure human oversight and monitoring, and providers have a post-market monitoring system in place. Providers and deployers will also report serious incidents and malfunctioning.

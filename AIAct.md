**EU AI Act 
The Pyramid of Risk: The Act categorizes AI into four levels.

1. Unacceptable Risk: (Banned since Feb 2025). Includes social scoring, dark patterns, and biometric categorization.
2. High-Risk: Heavily regulated (coming online Aug 2026). This covers "critical" areas like infrastructure, education, and law enforcement.
3. Limited Risk: Mostly transparency obligations (e.g., you must know you're talking to a bot).
4. Minimal Risk: No obligations (e.g., spam filters, video games).

The Players: Learn the difference between a Provider (who builds the AI) and a Deployer (who uses it). The legal burden is vastly different for each.

Deployer: Someone professionally using an AI system

Provider: Someone that develops an AI system or general-purpose AI model, or has such a system developed and places it on the market or puts it into service under their own name or trademark

***How SCCs (Standard Contractual Clauses) Work
Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) are pre-approved legal templates used to ensure that personal data transferred from the EU to non-EU countries complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). They help maintain data protection standards and can be included in contracts between data controllers and processors

***DPF
The EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) is a self-certification mechanism for U.S. Companies that have self-certified under the DPF must comply with its principles, rules and obligations related to the processing of personal data of EEA individuals.

The European Commission considered that transfers of personal data from the EEA to companies certified under the DPF enjoy an adequate level of protection. As a result, personal data can be transferred freely to U.S. certified companies, without the need to put in place further safeguards or obtain an authorization.

The DPF applies to any type of personal data transferred from the EEA to the U.S., including personal data processed for commercial or health purposes, and human resources data collected in the context of an employment relationship, as long as the recipient company in the U.S. is self-certified under the DPF to process those types of data

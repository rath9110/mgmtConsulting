**Article 6: The 6 Lawful Bases for Processing as outlined in Art. 6 Paragraph 1

1. (a) Consent - The user said "Yes" clearly and affirmatively. (Use for: Newsletters, high-level tracking).

2. (b) Contract - You need the data to deliver what they bought. (Use for: Shipping addresses, payment info).

3. (c) Legal Obligation - The law says you have to. (Use for: Tax records, employment data).

4. (d) Vital Interests - Someone’s life is at risk. (Use for: Emergency medical data).

5. (e) Public Task - You are a government or public body.

6. (f) Legitimate Interests - The most flexible bucket. The business has a good reason that doesn't override the user's rights. (Use for: Fraud prevention, basic website analytics).


*** 6 (1)(a) Consent vs 6 (1)(b) Contract
How Consent is Obtained:
- Voluntary Agreement - Consent must be given freely without coercion.
- Informed - Individuals should understand what they are consenting to.

Methods:
- Checkboxes next to "I Agree" statements.
- Clear explanations of what data will be processed and for what purpose.
- Can be withdrawn at any time without affecting the core service.
- Options to withdraw consent at any time. They can say "No" and still use the core service.

How Contracts are Formed:
- Mutual Agreement - All parties must agree to the terms.
- Consideration - Something of value must be exchanged (e.g., services for payment).

Methods:
- The Transactional Contract - When a customer clicks "Place Order," they are entering into a contract for the purchase and delivery of goods. You don't need a separate "I consent to you having my address" checkbox because you literally cannot fulfill the contract (shipping the box) without that data.
- The Service Contract (T&Cs) - When a user creates an account, they "accept" your Terms and Conditions. This forms a contract for you to provide the account services (order history, loyalty points, saved preferences). ().
- Linked to the service. If they want the service, they must provide the data.
- If they "withdraw," the contract usually terminates (e.g., they cancel the order).
- You can make the service conditional on the data (no address = no delivery).

***Details of Legitimate Interests (6.1 (f))
The key elements that distinguish legitimate interest from other lawful bases include:
- No requirement for explicit consent from data subjects
- Ongoing validity that doesn’t expire like consent might
- Broader application covering commercial interests, public benefits, and individual interests
- Higher documentation standards requiring detailed assessments
- Stronger data subject rights, including the right to object

Proper documentation of your Legitimate Interest Assessment and respecting data subject rights, including the right to object, are essential for compliance and minimising privacy risks

The key elements of the legitimate interests provision can be broken down into a three-part test:
1. The Purpose Test (The "Why")
You must identify a specific, lawful interest for processing the data. It cannot be vague or speculative.
Requirements: The interest must be "present and effective" (needed now, not "maybe later").

Common Retail Examples:
- Direct marketing (subject to ePrivacy/soft opt-in rules).
- Fraud prevention.
- CRM management for existing customer relationships.
- Internal administrative functions.

No-no's: Using broad reasons like "general business improvement" or holding data for hypothetical future tech expansions.

2. The Necessity Test (The "How")
You must prove that the processing is a proportionate way to achieve your goal and that no less intrusive method exists.
Data Minimization: Can you achieve the same result with less data? (e.g., using a region instead of a full GPS coordinate).
Alternatives: If there is a way to get the same result without processing this specific personal data, you must do that instead.
Proportionality: The scale of data collection must match the importance of the goal. High-volume tracking for a minor business goal usually fails here.

3. The Balancing Test (The "Impact")
You must weigh your business interests against the individual’s fundamental rights and freedoms.
Factors Supporting the Business:
- The processing is expected by the customer (e.g., a fraud check during checkout).
- The privacy impact is minimal.
- You provide a clear, easy opt-out mechanism.
- Factors Supporting the Individual (The data isn't to be stored):
    - The data is sensitive or involves children.
    - The processing is unexpected or intrusive.
    - There is a high risk of "creepy" profiling or social/economic harm.
